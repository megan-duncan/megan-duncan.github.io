        <p class="section-title">What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence is your ability to understand your own emotions, as well as the emotions of those around you.</p>
        <p>When you understand your emotions and how they affect your behaviours and thoughts, it can help you to understand the behavior of others.</p>
        <p>You can also use that understanding to control the way that you react to things, if you would normally have negative self-talk after feeling disappointed, you can teach yourself to look for the positive aspects of the situation.</p>
        <p class="section-subtitle">EQ is defined by four components:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Self-awareness - the ability to recognize your own emotions and their affects, and knowing your strengths and weaknesses.</li>
          <li>Self-regulation - being able to control how your emotions affect your behaviours and thoughts, and having the ability to think before you act.</li>
          <li>Social-awareness - the ability to recognise the emotions of other people and understand how your actions can affect them.</li>
          <li>Social-regulation - your ability to make and grow good relationships, influence others, communicate well and manage conflict.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="section-title">How is it different to IQ?</p>
        <p>IQ is the measure of a person’s ability to use information and logic to answer questions.</p>
        <p>It has been used as a common form of intelligence testing and for a long time was thought to be an indicator of someone’s future success.</p>
        <p>IQ is like the inside of a computer and EQ is the user interface. If the computer can’t get the information to me in a way I can understand, I won’t be able to see how much information it contains.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <p class="section-title">Why is it important?</p>
        <p>Understanding your own emotions can lead to having self-confidence, you know what you are good at, and what is challenging for you, so you can back yourself when you need to.</p>
        <p>Being able to manage your emotional impulses can help you adapt to changing circumstances. It can also help you to maintain good mental health. If you can change the way you react when things go badly from “you can’t do this” to “if you try again you can do this” then your self-esteem will only get higher.</p>
        <p>Being able to understand other people’s emotions can help you to understand when they react negatively to things you do. This can mean that rather than ending a relationship with them because they were harsh, you can talk to them about why they reacted that way and work through the conflict.</p>
