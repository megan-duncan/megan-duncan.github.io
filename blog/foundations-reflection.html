          <h3>Three New things I've learned about myself and my ego</h3>
            <div class="paragraphs">  
              <p>I have, for as long as I can remember, had a fixed mindset but I am really working to change that.</p>
              <p>I find it very challenging to put my ego aside and ask for help.</p>
              <p>I found that I often felt very self-conscious posting any of my core blogs, I find the idea of being judged very scary.</p>

          <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <div class="paragraphs">  
              <p>I think having values that somewhat align with those around you is an important part of keeping a team harmonious. If you are there for similar reasons, you can work together more easily to achieve a goal.</p>
              <p>Empathy can make it easier to work with others, as rather than becoming angry or frustrated with them, you can understand why they might be doing what they are doing.</p>
              <p>Self awareness in how you react to situations, and in how you speak to yourself and others, means you can regulate your reactions and grow from mistakes, rather than dwell and become stagnant.</p>

          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <div class="paragraphs">  
              <p>Learning about growth mindset and changing from my fixed mindset has been the most challenging part of this core learning. I have always had a very stubborn, negative self talk, so letting myself 
                be wrong, and letting myself not know all the answers has been hard. I still have a way to go, as asking for help is still not easy for me, but I am working on it.</p>
              </div>  
      </div> 

      <div class="sections">
        <h3>What surprised you about the core learning?</h3>
          <div class="paragraphs">  
            <p>I was surprised by how resistant I was at times to share my learning, and by how sensitive my ego is. </p>
          </div>

      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
        <div class="paragraphs">  
          <p>I think it is improtant to be able to undertand where other people are coming from and how to relate to others.</p>
          <p>By focusing on core, we are now heading into bootcamp knowing a bit about each others backgrounds and how we tick, so we will be more able to work together as a group.</p>
          <p>Knowing how learning works, and how we each learn best means that when we are learning to code, we will be able to maximise how effective our study is, hopefully meaning we come out the other side as better web developers.</p>

      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer</h3>
        <div class="paragraphs">  
          <p>The time spent on core doesn't feel like a waste of time, I think, especially in adult learning it is important to understand HOW you learn in order to help to to DO the learning.</p>
