        <h1>Margin, Border or Padding.</h1>
        
        <p>Margin border and padding are all a part of the CSS box model, so first, Iâ€™ll go into a little about that.

               <div class="col-6"><p>To the left is a diagram of a box model. As you can see, it is made up of four layers</p>
                   <ul class="list">
                       <li>Content Box - the innermost layer where your content is displayed.</li>
                       <li>Padding Box - this sits right around your content box, inside the border and is white space.</li>
                       <li>Border Box - this wraps around your content and padding.</li>
                       <li>Margin Box - the outermost layer, wrapping your element and creating whitespace between it and any other elements.</li>
                   </ul>

           </div>
           <div class="row">
            <p>Each of these layers can be altered to change the way your element interacts with other elements on the page, below I will go into more detail about what these layers are, and how to alter them.
            But first, here is a handy analogy I came across online may help you to understand the box model.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="explainations">
            <p>Imagine that you have a set of framed and matted photographs hanging on a wall.</p>
                <p>Each photo is surrounded by a mat that puts space between the photo and the frame. That space would be the padding.</p>
                <p>The frame encloses the mat and the image. That would be the border.</p>
                <p>Each picture has a set amount of space around the outside. That is the margin. If two pictures are handing side by side with four inches between them, then we might say that they each have a two inch margin. The margin is the distance between an element and something else.</p>

            <p>Your content is the text/image (or anything else, really) that you want to be displayed on your page. You can change the sizer of your content using properties like width and height

        <div class="section-header"><h3>Padding</h3>
        </div>
           <div>
            <p>The padding is the whitespace between the content and the border.</p>
            <p>You can change the size of the padding by ising the property padding followed by the size you want eg:padding:10px</p>
