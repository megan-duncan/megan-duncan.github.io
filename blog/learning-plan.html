        <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
<p>My long term goal is to have more flexibility in my work and the ability to work from home. I want to have more balance in my life and being able to change my timetable when needed will help this. As for a career pathway, I am still unsure of where I want to end up, I am hoping that going through Dev will give me more of an idea.</p>

<h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
<p>A strength of mine in learning, is that I WANT to learn. When I am interested in the topic I am learning, I put my all in.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: I can be easily distracted, if my mind wanders, it can sometimes be hard for me to come back. To combat this, I have been setting a Pomodoro focus timer (that also doubles as a plant growing game) to make sure that when I am in my study zone, I stay there.</p>

<h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
<p>Though I have spent a lot of time working in teams, I have not had much experience working on group projects. I am hoping to come out of Dev able to work with a range of people and have some strategies for when things arenâ€™t going to plan.</p>

<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>

<p>I have made myself a timetable for foundations so I know when I am studying and when I am able to relax, this helps me to commit to being productive, because if I stop studying I know I will just have to do more at another time and cut into my free time.</p>
<p>I am using a Pomodoro timer, which means I am definitely getting some breaks to stretch my legs and rest my brain. This also means that I am more productive when I am learning because it is for just set times. I am also making sure I give myself down time in the evenings to read a book or go for a walk. I know it is important for me to have the time away from screens to keep myself from getting overwhelmed.</p>
<p>When things are starting to get to me, I will talk through what is happening with my partner. This always helps me to work out what I need to do or change to make me feel more in control.</p>

<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
<p>When I need help with content, I will first ask in the slack channel, to see if any of my peers can help me. If it is something that I believe is a facilitator issue, I will contact Joseph to help.</p>
<p>I also have a friend who has been through Dev and has offered her help with any issues I have, so if I feel it is something she could help with, I will contact her.</p>

<h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
<p>I expect that the facilitation team will either be able to help when I am stuck, or will be able to point me in the right direction if it is something I need to find myself. I also hope that if things appear to be overwhelming myself or any of my peers that they will support that person and assist them in getting the help they need.</p>

<h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
<p>During foundations I am working Weds and Thurs from 4pm to 8pm. Outside of this time I am focused on my study. I will be finishing at work the week before bootcamp so I will be able to focus entirely on my study. Outside of work, I have scheduled my study time in, to make my time as productive as I can.</p>
