        <h3 class="section-title">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <div class="paragraphs">  
          <p>My long term goal is to have more flexibility in my work and the ability to work from home. 
            I want to have more balance in my life and being able to change my timetable when needed will help this. 
            As for a career pathway, I am still unsure of where I want to end up, but I want to work in a company with a strong team culture.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
        <div class="paragraphs">  
          <p>A strength of mine in learning, is that I WANT to learn. When I am interested in the topic I am learning, I put my all in.</p>
          <p>Limitations: I can be easily distracted, if my mind wanders, it can sometimes be hard for me to come back. To combat this, I have been setting a Pomodoro focus timer.</p>
          <p>During foundations I have found it really challenging to ask for help and to let myself be wrong, this is going to make bootcamp really challenging, 
            though perhaps once I am in the same room as everyone I will find it easier to ask for help, as I will be able to see others doing the same.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="section-title">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
        <div class="paragraphs">  
          <p>Speaking in front of the group will be super challenging for me until I get to know them. When I am unsure of my abilities, I find it difficult to speak to groups.</p>
          <p>I will also find it challenging to stay motivated for 9 weeks, and staying on top of my mental health can be hard while Im busy, so that will be something I will work on.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="section-title">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
        <div class="paragraphs">  
          <p>Though I have spent a lot of time working in teams, I have not had much experience working on group projects. I am hoping to come out of Dev able to work with a range of 
            people and have some strategies for when things arenâ€™t going to plan.</p>
          <p>I would also like to become better at reflections and keeping a record of my learning.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="section-title">What are my expectations of the bootcamp team?</h3>
        <div class="paragraphs">  
          <p>I expect that the bootcamp team will either be able to help when I am stuck, or will be able to point me in the right direction if it is something I need to find myself. I also hope that if things appear to be overwhelming myself or any of my peers that they will support that person and assist them in getting the help they need.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="section-title">What are your expactations of yourself on bootcamp?</h3>
        <div class="paragraphs">  
          <p>I expect to work productively and complete all of my work by the dates I am meant to.</p>
          <p>I expect myself to communicate well with my teachers, peers and any others I come in contact with.</p>
          <p>I will be using a Pomodoro timer, which means I will be getting some breaks to stretch my legs and rest my brain. This also means that I can be more productive when I am learning because it is for just set times.</p>
          <p>To stay sane, I will set myself time in the evenings to read a book or go for a walk. I know it is important for me to have the time away from screens to keep myself from getting overwhelmed.</p>
          <p>When I need help with content, I will first ask my peers, as chances are, they are working through similar issues. If it is something that needs more help, I will ask one of my teachers.</p>
