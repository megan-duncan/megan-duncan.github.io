            <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
              <div class="paragraphs">  
                <p>By understanding the principles of neuroplasticity, people can change their beliefs that they cannot learn something.</p>
                <p>By understanding that our brains can still grow and develop new connections at any age, it can help someone to have a positive expectation of study and learning.</p>

            <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
              <div class="paragraphs">  
                <p>I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my own benefit by making sure I do some from of learning or coding every day.</p>
                <p>By using repetition, I will build stronger pathways that will help my brain to learn and improve my skills.</p>

            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
              <div class="paragraphs">  
                <p>Some ways to help increase neuroplasticity include getting enough sleep and engaging in exercise.</p>
                <p>Exercise helps promote increased blood flow and cell growth in the brain, while sleeping can help to give your brain a reset, getting rid of unused neural pathways and strengthening those that are still in use.</p>
                <p>Reviewing information or repeating it to others can help to strengthen neural pathways, so by teaching or telling others things I have learned, I can help increase my neuroplasticity.</p>

            <h3>what is is and why is it relevant?</h3>
              <div class="paragraphs">  
                <p>Growth Mindset is the idea that we can always improve and learn, rather than the idea that our intelligence and ability is static.</p>
                <p>This is relevant to study, as it changes things from pass/fail to more of a "with effort you will get better" result.</p>
                <p>This can change a learners response from giving up when it is hard, to asking for help, or trying again.</p>

            <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
              <div class="paragraphs">  
                <p>I had never really heard of a growth mindset before, but identify strongly with the fixed mindset due to my experiences with learning in childhood.</p>
                <p>By identifying that my responses to not knowing things are a learned behaviour, I can work to unlearn them and change my mindset around asking for help, and letting people know when I'm finding things challenging.</p>

            <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
              <div class="paragraphs">  
                <p>I will integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey by acknowledging when things arent "clicking" for me, or when I'm finding things challenging.</p>
                <p>I will then either ask for help from fellow learners, or if I think it is more a matter for practicing, I will make time to go back over the content to let myself learn it, rather than giving up.</p>

              <div class="paragraphs">  
                <p>After taking into account neuroplasticity, I am going to commit to using my "coding brain" every day, to help strengthen my neural pathways.</p>
                <p>After learning that sleep is beneficial to learning, I am going to give myself a set bedtime (like a small child) to make sure I am giving my brain the best chance of recovery.</p>
                <p>As much as it pains me to say this, by engaging in daily exercise, I may be able to improve my learning, so I'm going to give that a go too.</p>
                <p>My default has always been a fixed mindset, but it turns out I can change that.</p>
                <p>I am going to forgive myself when I get things wrong and when I find learning difficult.</p>
                <p>When I feel like I want to give up, I will reframe how I'm looking at my result and take it as a way to further my learning.</p>
