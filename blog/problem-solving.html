          <h3>I got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
            <div class="paragraphs">  
              <p>During the Super FizzBuzz challenge, I got blocked about how to run a function in a for loop. A somewhat basic thing that my brain wasn't letting me do.</p>
              <p>The first problem solving techniques that I used was to google for how to do it, but my phrasing for my search meant that I didn't have a lot of luck.</p>
              <p>I then just tried some different things to make it work, which also wasn't helpful.</p>
              <p>In a break from coding, I did the Listen and Loop exercise with Benjamin. I told him what I was having issues with and he suggested watching back over the 
                FreeCodeCamp videos on for loops. Once I did that, everything was pretty straight forward. Thanks Benjamin!</p>
              <p>During the process of problem solving, I felt pretty frustrated, and at times wanted to give up, but through pushing to get it solved, I learned that asking for 
                help from peers is a great way to get you through a block.</p>

          <h3>I solved a problem in an elegant way</h3>
            <div class="paragraphs">  
              <p>Solving the deBee built-in methods challenge was as close to elegant problem solving as I've got.</p>
              <p>I started out by writing clear pseudocode, so I knew what is was that I needed to write code for.</p>
              <p>I then went through step by step, using the skills I had learned in the previous challenges to code each line of my pseudocode.</p>
              <p>By reading the error messages, console logging the output I got, I could change the strings I was filtering for and solve the problem.</p>
              <p>When I was unsure of how to use any of the built-in methods, I read the docs and googled, to get a clearer understanding.</p>
              <p>From this problem, I learned that pseudocode is an easy way for me to get a clear plan for how to solve a problem, and that I should use that more often.</p>
              <p>Doing the Katas also made it clear that through repetition, problem solving will get easier.</p>

          <h3>Problem solving techniques</h3>
          <h4>In the order I will use them</h4>
            <div class="paragraphs">  
              <p>Pseudocode - Now that I have practiced using it, I feel like this is a simple and very effective way to problem solve.</p>
              <p>Reading Error Messages - This is a great way to see immediately where you went wrong in your code, super helpful if I make a simple typo.</p>
              <p>Googling - I often use google to help me solve problems, but sometimes I don't quite know how to phrase what I am asking. Another challenge with this, 
                is that the information I get back is sometimes more confusing than the problem I am solving!</p>
              <p>Console Logging - This is super helpful to show whether I am accessing the correct data with my code. I use this frequently to check that I am on the right tracj before moving to the next step.</p>
              <p>Trying Something - When google isn't helping and I think I might have an answer myself, I use trial and error to problem solve, console logging regularly to see if I'm making a difference.</p>
              <p>Asking Peers for Help - I have done this only once, and mainly because we were already talking about the kata in a different context. I need to get better at this, but I often feel guilty taking up
                peoples time when they have things they also need to be doing. Funnily enough, I would always be happy to help someone else, so I should probably just ask.</p>
              <p>Asking Coaches for Help - Again, I have a complex about asking for help, but I need to get over that. I think once we are in person I will find this easier, as my coaches will be nearby, 
                and I will think of them as an option sooner.</p>
              <p>Rubber Ducky Method - I don't tend to do a lot of outside-of-my-head talking to myself, but I do often have an internal monologue working through problems.</p>
              <p>Improving your Process with Reflection - Reflection is not something that I find very easy. When I have done it duiring this course, I have found it helpful, but I need to make a conscious effort to practice it.</p>
