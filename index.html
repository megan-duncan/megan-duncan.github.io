    <p>This is where you will one day be able to read blog posts written by me. It is currently somewhat light on the content, so do bear with.</p>
    
    <p>For now, you can use this page to learn a bit about me, Megan (aka the gal staring at you from that photo over there <--)</p>

    <p>I'm based in Wellington, though I am originally from the West Coast of the South Island, and I spend most weekends in Waikanae Beach.</p>

      <p>I enjoy surfing, reading, going for walks with my girlfriend and our dog Pipi (aka the gal staring at you from that photo over there -->), and I spend far too much time watching Netflix.</p>

      <p>I've been in the hairdressing industry for 12 years and I am ready for a change, so here I am.</p>
