          <h3 class="section-title">Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>
          <h4 class="section-subtitle">My core personal values are..</h4>
          <p>Compassion, towards people and animals. I am a very empathetic person, I believe in trying to understand how people are feeling to better understand their actions.</p>
          <p>Love, I am very passionate about my family, friends and loved ones. </p>
          <p>Equality, as a queer woman, equality for all is a value close to my heart. I believe that ethnicity, gender, and sexuality shouldnt be a factor in what opportunities and resources someone has available to them.</p>
          <p>Loyalty, I am loyal to people with whom I have mutual respect and trust</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h3 class="section-title">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</h3>
          <h4 class="section-subtitle">Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h4>
          <p>In a workplace I discovered that a teammate was abusing a system that they had access to for their own benefit and had to decide whether to tell my employer.</p>
          <p>On one side, my compassion and loyalty for my teammate meant I didnt want them to get in trouble.</p>
          <p>On the other side, my loyalty to my employer and my concern that letting the behaviour continue wasn't fair to the team or my boss.</p>
          <p>It was a hard decision to make, but I chose to give my boss the information because the gains being made by the teammate challenged my sense of equality, and I would want to know if I was in their position.</p>
          <p>The consequences of the action were that I felt a sense of relief and the issue was raised with the whole team to ensure the correct process was followed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h3 class="section-title">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
          <p>My values were influenced more by my identity and the culture I became a part of because of it, rather than the culture I grew up in.</p>
          <p>As a queer person, my idea of equality comes from generations of queer people being treated as second class citizens, and knowing that sexuality, ethnicity, religion, socio-economic status or gender should never be a reason to treat someone unfairly.</p>
          <p>I've always been aware of how many people from within the queer communities lose those closest to them so compassion, love and loyalty come from prioritising the people and meaningful relationships in my world.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h3 class="section-title">Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
          <h4 class="section-subtitle">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>
          <div class="section">
          <h4 class="section-subtitle">Strengths</h4>
          <p>Empathy means that in a work or learning environment I can understand my teammates and know how to include them and treat them fairly. 
              It can be super helpful for peace keeping in a team with differing personalities and challenges.</p>
          <p>Kindness, I like to help others and love celebrating other peoples wins. I want everyone to achieve and will do what I can to make that happen.
              This tends to mean teammates enjoy having me around as it is beneficial to them too.</p>
          <p>Open-Mindedness means I can get along with a wide range of people. I try not to judge anyone elseâ€™s beliefs, lifestyles, or decisions. This
              means I tend to fit into teams quite well.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <h4 class="section-subtitle">Limitations</h4>
            <p>People pleasing tendencies mean I find conflict stressful and can find it hard to have hard conversations with teammates, though this is something I
              have been working on for the last couple of years.</p>
            <p>Self-Critical, I believe that I have potential to do well, but when I don't do well I tend to blame my "uselessness" or "inadequacies" this can mean
              when I find things difficult I'm tempted to give up.</p>
            <p>Self-Isolating/shy, in new environments I am standoffish which can stop me from making new friends which can mean it takes me longer to become part 
              of a team.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h3 class="section-title">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
          <p>My open-mindedness may mean that I form friendships with people who have different perspectives to mine who may look at problems differently to myself,
              meaning if I have a challenge I cant solve, they may see it differently and help me solve it.</p>
          <p>My kindness can mean people like working in a team with me, this could mean that I have more people to ask for help if and when I get stuck.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h3 class="section-title">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.</h3>
          <h4 class="section-subtitle">Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h4>
          <p>I used to run team meetings at my previous job, which occasionally would require periods of group work within a time limit. The resistance tended to 
              be more that people got off task and talked through it rather than intentional resistance.</p>
          <p>At the time I would try and bargain with them around what 
                  we could do if we finished the task sooner which tended to work quite well.</p>
          <p>In future I could use my empathy to understand that people all have different levels or engagement and interest and work with them to set an agreed
                      plan for the session that we can all hold each other accountable to. Having buy in from everyone created a stronger sense of ownership for each 
                      person in the group and it allows me to be a leader without it feeling overly heirarchical or dominant.</p>
